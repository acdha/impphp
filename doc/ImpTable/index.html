				Yahoo has included <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/">a rich table control</a> in <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI</a>. The original ImpTable class was written years ago and while it was quite handy for quickly generating valid, sortable, stylable HTML tables it was entirely server-side and had no provision for loading external data, editing, custom formatting, etc. Rather than re-invent the wheel I decided to convert it to a YUI DataTable. The goal is simplicity: ImpTable now allows you to create a DataTable using two lines of PHP while still allowing you to customize it extensive using CSS and JavaScript to take advantage of DataTable's rich set of features.
			</p>
			<p>
				ImpTable tries to make the process of including a YUI DataTable as simple as possible, including automatically loading YUI if your page does not already use it. If you're already using YUI, I strongly recommend loading the DataTable and DataSource modules along with your other components to avoid version mismatches.
